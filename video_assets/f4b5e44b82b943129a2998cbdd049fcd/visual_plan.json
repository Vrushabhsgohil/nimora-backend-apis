  "technical_notes": "Ensure consistent product geometry throughout all shots; reflections and sparkle highlights must be physically accurate, with no distortion or fake effects. Use soft, precise lighting to achieve high contrast with rich, realistic metallic and gemstone reflections. Maintain a monochrome palette emphasizing gray tones, polished gold surfaces, and sparkle details. No visual distortions or AI-generated variations; the product must stay identical in shape and proportions across all scenes."
