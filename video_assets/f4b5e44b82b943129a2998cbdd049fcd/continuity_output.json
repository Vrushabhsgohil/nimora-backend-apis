  "feedback": "The visual plan explicitly states the need for 'product geometry remains fixed and identical to reference' and 'no morphing, distortion, or AI artifacts', which aligns with product consistency rules. However, the final prompt states 'no morphing, distortion, or AI artifacts', and emphasizes that 'the product remains identical to reference'. But it also mentions 'incorporate macro sparkle highlights, realistic reflections, and subsurface scattering', which could potentially imply effects that alter the product's appearance or involve AI-generated effects, risking inconsistency. Despite the technical details, the description about 'realistic reflections' and 'subsurface scattering' may suggest alterations that could violate the strict 'product consistency' rule. Additionally, the visual plan mentions 'reflections and sparkle highlights must be physically accurate, with no distortion or fake effects,' but the prompt includes 'macro sparkle highlights', which could be seen as creating artificial sparkle enhancement, potentially conflicting with the requirement for physical accuracy and consistency. Therefore, the safe conclusion is that the overall prompt may suggest effects that could distort or modify the product, risking inconsistency.",
