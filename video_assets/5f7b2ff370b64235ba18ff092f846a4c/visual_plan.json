  "technical_notes": "Ensure the jewellery's shape, stone placement, and design details remain perfectly consistent throughout all shots. Reflections and sparkle highlights must be physically accurate and natural, avoiding any artificial glows or exaggerated effects. Use macro lenses (100mm f/2.8) for close-ups, soft focus for background separation, and maintain high contrast with clean whites and deep blacks during post-color grading. Highlight the richness of gold, green stones, and meticulous craftsmanship without introducing distortions or misalignments."
