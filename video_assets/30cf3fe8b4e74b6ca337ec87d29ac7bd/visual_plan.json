  "technical_notes": "Ensure all reflections and sparkle effects are physically accurate, with no overblown star filters or artificial glows. Maintain consistent geometry of the jewellery throughout all scenes, with precise lighting to highlight filigree textures and reflective surfaces. Use macro lenses (100mm) for close-up details at f/2.8, appropriate focus pulls, and steady camera movements. White cyclorama background should remain clean and neutral during orbit and reveal shots to preserve color accuracy and luxury aesthetic."
