  "final_prompt": "A highly detailed, photorealistic 8k video of the timeless Indian gold necklace set, showcasing intricate floral motifs and dangling filigree elements, animated through slow, cinematic movements with macro diamond facet detailing. The scene employs soft, warm diffused lighting with a gentle spotlight and ambient gold glow to evoke regal opulence, emphasizing craftsmanship, reflections, and textures. The necklace remains perfectly static on a luxurious surface, with the camera executing precise macro shots, slow dolly-in reveals, stable slow orbital rotation, and a gentle pull-away, all with static product geometry strictly maintained. Use phase one IQ4, 100mm macro lens at f/2.8, unrealistic engine 5.4 realism, subsurface scattering, and ultra-smooth bokeh, ensuring reflections and sparkle effects are physically accurate and consistent across scenes. The background is a deep textured surface and white cyclorama backdrop, with no signs of distortion, morphing, or AI artifacts, maintaining visual consistency and luxury aesthetic throughout.",
