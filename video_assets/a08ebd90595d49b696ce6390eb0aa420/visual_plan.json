  "technical_notes": "Ensure reflections and sparkle are physically accurate, with caustics responsive to gemstone cuts. Use a 100mm macro lens at f/2.0 for sharp focus and shallow depth of field. Maintain consistent high-key lighting without harsh shadows to preserve a luxurious, clean aesthetic. The ring's shape, size, and reflective properties must remain 100% consistent throughout the shot sequence, avoiding any distortions or effects that alter its geometry or appearance."
