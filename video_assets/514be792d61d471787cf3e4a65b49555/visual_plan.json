  "technical_notes": "Utilize 8K resolution with prime macro lens (e.g., 100mm f/2.8) for sharp texture. Maintain shallow depth of field (f/1.8 - f/2.2) to isolate the jewels. Ensure natural caustics to accentuate gemstone brilliance. Use stabilised dolly or macro focus pull for smooth key movements. Colors should be graded to warm golds with lush greens, with careful control of highlights to avoid overexposure of metal or stones."
