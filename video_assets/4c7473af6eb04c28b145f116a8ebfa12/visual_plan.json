  "technical_notes": "Maintain a 4K resolution with a shallow depth of field (f/2.0). Use a 100mm macro lens for extreme detail. Lighting should be anchored around the product structure with warm, even tones and subtle flickering to mimic traditional diya flames, avoiding any overexposure or artificial effects. Reflections and gemstone facets must respond realistically to lighting. The product must remain consistent in shape and appearance throughout all frames, with physically accurate details on the cut and clarity of the central stone."
