  "technical_notes": "Maintain strict product consistency with accurate geometry, and avoid any distortions or artificial effects. Use high-quality macro lenses (100mm macro, f/2.8) for close-up shots to capture detailed sparkle and texture. Lighting should emulate warm, royal tones with soft diffusion, emphasizing richness and craftsmanship without overexposing the stones. Background remains a clean, luxurious champagne silk to complement the Indian regal aesthetic. Reflections on metals and stones must be physically accurate and natural, avoiding any artificial glow or over-bright highlights."
