  "technical_notes": "Reflective surfaces of the gold and intricate details must maintain consistent realistic sparkle, avoiding overexposure or artificial glow. Lighting angles should emphasize craftsmanship without creating distracting reflections. Depth of field should be soft enough to isolate the product yet preserve fine detail. All shots must uphold the product's exact shape, size, and design integrity throughout to comply with the 'Golden Rule.' The environment should complement the heritage theme with warm tones and natural light, avoiding any unnatural color grading or filters outside the specified warm, luxurious palette."
