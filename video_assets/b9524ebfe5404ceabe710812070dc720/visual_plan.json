  "technical_notes": "Strictly maintain product integrity with consistent shape, size, and stone placement. Use macro lenses (e.g., 100mm macro) at f/2.0 for shallow depth. Incorporate caustic light effects passing through gemstones to create natural refractive patterns. Employ smooth, slow camera movements for elegance. The lighting setup should highlight the gold texture and gemstone fire, with rim lighting creating a subtle halo effect for an ethereal mood."
