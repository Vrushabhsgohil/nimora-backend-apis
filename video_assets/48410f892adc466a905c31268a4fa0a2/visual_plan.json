  "technical_notes": "Use naturalistic physics for light reflection on metal and gemstones, ensuring textures and sparkle are realistic. Maintain product consistency by avoiding any distortion or morphing effects. Implement smooth slow-motion interpolations for shimmer and glitter highlights to preserve a natural, premium feel. Lighting should accentuate craftsmanship details with subtle shadows for depth, avoiding harsh contrasts."
